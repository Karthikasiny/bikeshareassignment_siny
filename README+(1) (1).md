# BIKE SHARE ASSIGNMENT
Data Collection and Preparation: Gather and preprocess data from multiple sources to ensure its quality, remove any inconsistencies, and transform it into a format suitable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct thorough exploratory analysis to identify patterns, trends, and correlations in the data that could be useful for model building.

Model Building: Utilize various machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification, or time-series forecasting to build predictive models that address the business problem.

Model Evaluation and Optimization: Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or RMSE, and fine-tune hyperparameters to improve model robustness and predictive power.
